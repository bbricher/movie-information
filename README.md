## Problem

This app will help people find information about movies, songs, and concerts. Everyone always thinks that google is the answer to everything, but sometimes using something a bit more specific (like this app), can save you from a lot of ads, and from clicking on several sites before actually finding the information you need. This app saves time and in turn saves money! 


## Overview
This app uses node to run input data from the command line. Once a user input is submitted, an if statement is use to execute based off of what search type you entered. Each search type uses a different API to collect the data connected to what you're searching for. The first object found with your search will be what information is put out.


## Instructions

This app is ran with node through the command line. If you want to find a concert type 'node liri.js concert-this' then add the artist you would like to search, to find a song replace'concert-this' with 'spotify-this-song' along with a song and to find a movie use 'movie-this' along with a movie. Once submitted information about what you looked up will appear!

## My Role
